# ðŸŽ¥ Machine Learning Documentary

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Documentary** project, a collaborative effort between [Prajna EP](https://github.com/PrajnaEP) and [Mohammed Dayyan](https://github.com/MDAYYAN-007). This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive introduction to the world of **Machine Learning (ML)** using Jupyter Notebooks. We aim to explain the core concepts of ML, explore key algorithms, and present real-world use cases.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

Our documentary will take you on a journey through Machine Learning, including:

### ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Machine Learning
- What is Machine Learning?
- Importance of ML

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Machine Learning
We will cover the two major types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
   - Use cases: Predicting outcomes based on labeled data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.
   - Use cases: Discovering hidden patterns in data without labels.

### ðŸ”¹ Popular Machine Learning Algorithms
We will dive deep into the working principles, applications, and pros/cons of popular algorithms under both supervised and unsupervised learning.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Applications
Discover how ML is applied in real-world scenarios across industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and more.
