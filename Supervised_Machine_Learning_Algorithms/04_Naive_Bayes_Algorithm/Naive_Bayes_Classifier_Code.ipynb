    "## Naive Bayes Classifier\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The **Naive Bayes Classifier** is a widely used machine learning algorithm based on **Bayes' Theorem**. It works well for classification tasks by making the assumption that all features are independent of each other â€” hence the term \"naive.\" While this assumption may not always hold in real-world data, the model still performs surprisingly well in many scenarios such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnoses. The algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to implement, making it a go-to choice for many applications.\r\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Summary:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the Python code provided, we use the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether a person will have a fever based on two binary symptoms: COVID and Flu. The model calculates **prior probabilities** (the likelihood of fever occurring overall) and **conditional probabilities** (the likelihood of fever given the presence or absence of COVID and Flu). \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Training Data**: This includes binary inputs representing whether a person has COVID or Flu (1 for Yes, 0 for No), along with corresponding labels indicating if the person has a fever.\r\n",
    "- **Predictions**: After training the model, we test it on all four possible combinations of COVID and Flu to see whether the model predicts fever or no fever for each case.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This simple implementation demonstrates how Naive Bayes can be applied to a classification problem using binary data, and it highlights the basic principles of probability-based learning."
