    "# KNN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. KNN stands for K Nearest Neighbors. Let's explore both classification and regression, starting with classification in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KNN Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In KNN classification, the algorithm finds the K nearest data points (neighbors) to the new point whose category needs to be predicted. The majority class among these K neighbors is chosen, and the new point is assigned to that class. The algorithm uses a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance) to find the nearest neighbors. The value of K is a hyperparameter, i.e, it can be adjusted based on the dataset to improve the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How KNN Classification Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select K: Choose the number of neighbors (K).\n",
    "2. Measure Distance: Use a distance metric (like Euclidean distance) to calculate the distance between the new data point and the other points in the dataset.\n",
    "3. Find Neighbors: Identify the K closest neighbors to the new data point.\n",
    "4. Majority: The most frequent category among the K neighbors becomes the predicted category for the new point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make this clearer with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a dataset of animals classified as either \"Cat\" or \"Dog\" based on two features: Weight and Height. Below is the dataset with 10 animals:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Animal | Weight (kg) | Height (cm) | Class |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| Cat 1  | 4           | 25          | Cat   |\n",
    "| Cat 2  | 3.5         | 23          | Cat   |\n",
    "| Cat 3  | 5           | 28          | Cat   |\n",
    "| Cat 4  | 6           | 30          | Cat   |\n",
    "| Cat 5  | 4.5         | 24          | Cat   |\n",
    "| Dog 1  | 10          | 60          | Dog   |\n",
    "| Dog 2  | 12          | 70          | Dog   |\n",
    "| Dog 3  | 8           | 50          | Dog   |\n",
    "| Dog 4  | 9           | 65          | Dog   |\n",
    "| Dog 5  | 7           | 55          | Dog   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a visualization of the current dataset, plotting both Cats and Dogs on a graph by their weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph of Animal Dataset](images/KNN_Classification_Example1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine we find a new animal with these characteristics:\n",
    "- Weight: 9 kg\n",
    "- Height: 55 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal? To classify this new animal as either a Cat or a Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we’ll plot the new animal (9 kg, 55 cm) on the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph with New Animal](images/KNN_Classification_Example_With_New_Point.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's Walk Through the Process:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose K: Let’s say we choose (K = 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Distance: We calculate the Euclidean distance from the new animal to each animal in our dataset using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(Weight_{new} - Weight_{old})^2 + (Height_{new} - Height_{old})^2}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example:\n",
    "   - Distance to Cat 1:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sqrt{(9 - 4)^2 + (55 - 25)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 900} = \\sqrt{925} \\approx 30.41\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Distance to Cat 2:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sqrt{(9 - 3.5)^2 + (55 - 23)^2} = \\sqrt{30.25 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1054.25} \\approx 32.47\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Distance to Dog 1:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sqrt{(9 - 10)^2 + (55 - 60)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 25} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.10\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Distance to Dog 5:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sqrt{(9 - 7)^2 + (55 - 55)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 0} = \\sqrt{4} = 2.00\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similar calculations can be done for the rest of the animals in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sort Distances: After calculating the distances, we sort them in ascending order and select the K nearest neighbors (in this case K = 3 ):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Dog 5: Distance = 2.00\n",
    "   - Dog 1: Distance = 5.10\n",
    "   - Dog 3: Distance = 5.10 \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Checking Majority: We now check the classes of the 3 nearest neighbors:\n",
    "   - Dog 5 is a Dog.\n",
    "   - Dog 1 is a Dog.\n",
    "   - Dog 3 is a Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since all 3 neighbors are Dogs, we classify the new animal as a Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the graph highlighting the three nearest neighbors to the new animal:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph with Nearest Neighbors](images/KNN_Classification_Example_With_New_Point_Nearest_Neighbours.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the three closest animals to the new one, KNN finds that the majority class is \"Dog.\" Therefore, the algorithm classifies this new animal as a Dog based on its weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KNN Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) isn’t just for classification tasks; it’s also great for regression, where the goal is to predict a continuous value—like a house price. Instead of classifying data into categories, KNN regression predicts a value by looking at similar data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How KNN Regression Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select K: Choose the number of nearest neighbors (K).\n",
    "2. Measure Distance: Use a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to calculate the distance between the new data point and the other points.\n",
    "3. Find Neighbors: Identify the K nearest neighbors to the new data point.\n",
    "4. Average the Values: Take the average of the target values (e.g., house prices) for the K neighbors, and use this as the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through an example using house prices as the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a dataset of houses with two features: Size (in square meters) and Distance to City Center (in km). The target value is the Price (in 1000s of currency units) of the house. Here's the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| House  | Size (sqm) | Distance to City Center (km) | Price (1000s) |\n",
    "|--------|------------|------------------------------|---------------|\n",
    "| House 1| 50         | 5                            | 250           |\n",
    "| House 2| 60         | 7                            | 270           |\n",
    "| House 3| 80         | 10                           | 300           |\n",
    "| House 4| 100        | 12                           | 320           |\n",
    "| House 5| 40         | 3                            | 200           |\n",
    "| House 6| 75         | 9                            | 280           |\n",

    "| House 8| 55         | 4                            | 230           |\n",
    "| House 9| 85         | 11                           | 310           |\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to predict the price of a new house with the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Size: 65 sqm\n",
    "- Distance to City Center: 6 km\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a visualization of the house dataset with prices plotted against size and distance:\n",

    "### Walking Through the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose K: Let's start by choosing K = 5 (3 nearest neighbors).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Distance: Use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance from the new house to each house in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(Size_{new} - Size_{old})^2 + (Distance_{new} - Distance_{old})^2}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sort Distances: After calculating, we sort the distances and select the 3 nearest neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Average the Values: Once we have the nearest neighbors, we average their prices.\n",

    "![Graph with Nearest Neighbors](images/KNN_Regression_Example_With_Neighbors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we predicted the price of a new house based on its size and distance to the city center. The algorithm found the 3 nearest neighbors and averaged their prices to predict the price of the new house. KNN regression works similarly for any continuous data where the goal is to predict a value based on the characteristics of similar data points.\n",
